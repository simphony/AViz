	AViz is a tool to graphically display results of atomistic simulations.
These results typically consist of large data sets of coordinates,
where the coordinates represent atoms or spins in three-dimensional space.

	AViz lets you view the data sets, and you can easily produce stills and 
sequences of stills ready to be turned into animations. 

	AViz is coded using the Qt toolkit and the OpenGL graphics library.  It 
runs on UNIX-systems on which Qt and OpenGL is installed.

	AViz makes use of various SoQt widgets developed by Coin 
(www.coin3d.org), but does not use Coin's alternative implementation of the 
Inventor 3D graphics library.  

	AViz is developed at the Computational Physics Group, Technion, 
Haifa (Israel).
